        <h2>Football Manager Player Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>As I mentioned previously, Football Manager is a very data-driven game. Community-made, downloadable skins
            can be used for different types of data analysis based on how the user wants to play the game. I like using 
            the Statman and SaS skins pictured below, as their data centers allow for the broadest range and most specific 
            queries regarding player, club, and league information. Identifying certain player statistics and attributes 
            that best fit your tactic in order to sign the best players is my favorite part of the game, and can sometimes
            require an extensive amount of data visualization and comparison. YouTubers and Football Manager community members
            make videos and blogs on different approaches on how to best analyze player data in the game. YouTuber 
            squirrel_plays has a great series on exporting game data to Python in order to do more in-depth and realistic 
            analysis.

        <h3>Data Analysis aside, Football Manager is tons of fun. Creating tactics, dealing with different player personalities, 
            watching your team play games, and the emotional rollercoaster of each season help make it my favorite game. I've been 
            playing since FM20, released in 2019, and have completed a variety of challenges with Football Clubs all over the world.
            
            Here's a list of some of my favorite save files:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>My first ever save I won the European Champions League with German club Eintracht Frankfurt after five seasons</li>
            <li>In FM23 I completed the "Pentagon Challenge" in which you win each Continental Competition with a club from that continent.</li>
            <li>In FM24 I used Crewe Alexandra, from the fifth tier of English football, and won the English Premier League and European Champions League</li>
            <li>Once again, in FM24, I made Argentian club Boca Juniors the wealthiest club in world exclusively by building up and selling youth talent</li>
        </ul>
