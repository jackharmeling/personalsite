        <p>I'm Jack Harmeling, a second-year Data Science at Northeastern University. Some of my hobbies are reading, playing basketball,
            listening to music, hanging out with my friends, and watching sports. I'm interested in machine learning and predictive models,
            and for a recent project I predicted NBA MVP voting using ML models (somewhat succesfully). I'm from San Diego, California and have three
            dogs. Something I'm passionate about is my favorite video game, Football Manager. Football Manager puts you in the shoes of the Manager 
            position of any soccer club in the world - you're in charge of managing finances, signing players, setting up training, keeping players and the
            board happy, among a number of other tasks. The game is very data-driven, and different skins and databases can be downloaded in order to
            further analyze player and financial data in order to further your team's success. The game makes loads of data available on every subject you could
            need - player/manager/club skill, personality, history, stats, etc. Analysis is an extremely important aspect of the game, as using player data to make 
            the best signings and tactics is the only way to succeed without getting sacked. Football Manager was the original reason I wanted to pursue Data Science
            as a major, and thus I thought would be appropriate to make this website about.
